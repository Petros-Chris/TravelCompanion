# travel_companion

A application where you can look at a map, add personal markers on the map, and save points in the map with photos and descriptions.

Currently, only the login system is implemented.

# How To Run
Simply install the apk provided in the releases tab and install it onto your phone.

# State Management Used
To manage the screen size and the user profile, I used Provider. This was so I could easily update the UI with new data when required.
